# PowerBI
From one of Chris Dutton courses on powerbi by Maven Analytics , I used the dataset to create this report and derived the following insights.

Key Insight


📍Customers on an average income level generated more revenue for the company with a marginal difference of $11.15m in comparison with the very high income earners.


📍Curator holdings saw a sharp decline in profit from June to July and a slight increase by August.


📍The highest profit ($1.32m) was generated in the month of May and 2016 generated the highest revenue($9.3m).


📍Using a 95% confidence interval level, we can predict that curator holdings might see an increase in the revenue for the next two years.


📍United States and Australia generated the highest revenue and profit


📍The Accessories product category has the highest order but generated lesser profit in comparison to Bikes. This being the fact that bikes are more expensive.


📍Curator holding is behind their target revenue and profit for the current year(2017).


📍Mr. Maurice Shan is the company's top 1 customer generating a revenue of $12.4k for the company.
